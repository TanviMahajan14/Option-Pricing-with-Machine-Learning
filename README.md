# Option-Pricing-with-Machine-Learning
This project presents an end-to-end pipeline for option pricing using machine learning techniques, integrating historical financial data, technical indicators, and predictive models. The goal is to model and forecast the prices of financial derivatives (options) using a data-driven approach.

📌 Project Overview
This repository includes:

Data acquisition using the Yahoo Finance API

Feature engineering using technical indicators (RSI, MACD, volatility)

Implementation of machine learning models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest)

Evaluation of model performance for option price prediction

Integration of financial and statistical theory to enhance model accuracy

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, yFinance, SciPy)

Jupyter Notebook

Yahoo Finance API

Machine Learning Algorithms for Regression

📈 Key Features
Fetch and preprocess historical stock price and option chain data

Calculate financial indicators such as:

Relative Strength Index (RSI)

Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)

Annualized Volatility

Predict option prices using supervised ML models

Analyze the impact of different features on prediction accuracy

📊 Sample Use Cases
Evaluate and predict option prices based on historical trends

Understand the role of technical indicators in derivative valuation

Serve as a base model for algorithmic trading systems

✅ Future Improvements
Incorporate more advanced models (e.g., XGBoost, Neural Networks)

Evaluate implied vs. predicted prices using market options data

Extend to multi-asset or portfolio-level analysis
