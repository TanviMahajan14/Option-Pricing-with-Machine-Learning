# 🧠 Machine Learning-Based Option Pricing Framework

This project presents an end-to-end pipeline for **option pricing using machine learning techniques**, integrating historical financial data, technical indicators, and predictive models. The goal is to model and forecast the prices of financial derivatives (options) using a data-driven approach.

## 📌 Project Overview

This repository includes:
- Data acquisition using the **Yahoo Finance API**
- Feature engineering using **technical indicators** (RSI, MACD, volatility)
- Implementation of **machine learning models** (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest)
- Evaluation of model performance for **option price prediction**
- Integration of financial and statistical theory to enhance model accuracy

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, yFinance, SciPy)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Yahoo Finance API
- Machine Learning Algorithms for Regression

## 📈 Key Features
- Fetch and preprocess historical stock price and option chain data
- Calculate financial indicators such as:
  - Relative Strength Index (RSI)
  - Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)
  - Annualized Volatility
- Predict option prices using supervised ML models
- Analyze the impact of different features on prediction accuracy

## 📊 Sample Use Cases
- Evaluate and predict option prices based on historical trends
- Understand the role of technical indicators in derivative valuation
- Serve as a base model for algorithmic trading systems

## ✅ Future Improvements
- Incorporate more advanced models (e.g., XGBoost, Neural Networks)
- Evaluate implied vs. predicted prices using market options data
- Extend to multi-asset or portfolio-level analysis
